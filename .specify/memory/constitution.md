# FisioFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Type Safety First
All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. No `any` types allowed except for explicit third-party library interfaces. React components MUST have proper TypeScript props interfaces. Service layer functions MUST have typed parameters and return values.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All business logic MUST have unit tests. Critical user flows MUST have integration tests. Test coverage MUST be maintained above 80% for service layer and core components.

### III. User Experience Consistency
UI components MUST follow established design patterns and styling conventions. All user interactions MUST provide feedback (loading states, success/error messages). Forms MUST have validation with clear error messages. Navigation MUST be intuitive and consistent across all modules. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be followed.

### IV. Performance Standards
Page load times MUST not exceed 2 seconds on 3G connections. Bundle size MUST remain under 1MB per route chunk. API responses MUST complete within 500ms for standard operations. Memory usage MUST not exceed 100MB for client-side operations. All images MUST be optimized and lazy-loaded.

### V. Code Quality & Architecture
Code MUST follow established patterns: service layer for business logic, custom hooks for reusable stateful logic, proper component composition. No business logic in React components. All external API calls MUST be wrapped in service functions. Error handling MUST be centralized and consistent. Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming conventions.

## Development Standards

### Code Review Requirements
All pull requests MUST pass automated type checking, linting, and tests before review. Code reviews MUST verify adherence to all constitutional principles. Performance impact MUST be assessed for any changes affecting critical user paths. Security review MUST be conducted for any changes to authentication, data handling, or AI integration.

### Quality Gates
Pre-commit hooks MUST verify TypeScript compilation and basic linting. CI/CD pipeline MUST run full test suite and performance benchmarks. Production deployments MUST pass smoke tests for all critical user flows. Bundle analysis MUST be performed to prevent size regressions.

## Healthcare Domain Requirements

### Data Security & Privacy
Patient data MUST be handled according to healthcare privacy standards. All sensitive data MUST be validated and sanitized. AI features MUST include appropriate disclaimers about clinical decision-making. Audit trails MUST be maintained for all patient data modifications.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require documentation of impact, approval from project lead, and migration plan for existing code. All development decisions MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity that violates principles MUST be justified with documented rationale or refactored to comply.
