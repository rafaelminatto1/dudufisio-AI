## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A physiotherapy clinic with 744 patients and 669 monthly appointments needs a comprehensive digital management system to streamline patient care, appointment scheduling, treatment tracking, and clinic operations while ensuring healthcare compliance and improving patient outcomes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Patient Management Flow:**
1. **Given** a new patient arrives at clinic, **When** receptionist creates patient record with required information, **Then** system validates data and creates complete patient profile with unique identifier
2. **Given** existing patient data, **When** physiotherapist accesses patient record, **Then** system displays complete medical history, treatment progress, and scheduled appointments
3. **Given** patient consent, **When** physiotherapist marks pain points on body map, **Then** system records location, intensity, and creates visual pain timeline

**Appointment Management Flow:**
1. **Given** available appointment slots, **When** user schedules new appointment, **Then** system checks conflicts and confirms booking with automatic notifications
2. **Given** scheduled appointment, **When** patient needs to reschedule, **Then** system offers alternative slots and updates all stakeholders
3. **Given** multiple physiotherapists, **When** viewing weekly schedule, **Then** system displays color-coded calendar with all appointments organized by provider

**Treatment & Exercise Flow:**
1. **Given** patient assessment, **When** physiotherapist prescribes exercises, **Then** system creates personalized exercise plan with videos and tracking capabilities
2. **Given** exercise prescription, **When** patient logs into portal, **Then** system displays assigned exercises with demonstration videos and progress tracking
3. **Given** completed sessions, **When** generating patient report, **Then** system compiles treatment history, pain evolution, and exercise compliance

**Financial Management Flow:**
1. **Given** completed appointments, **When** generating monthly financial report, **Then** system calculates revenue, outstanding payments, and growth metrics
2. **Given** payment information, **When** processing patient payment, **Then** system records transaction and updates account balance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when patient has multiple concurrent treatments?
- How does system handle appointment cancellations within 24 hours?
- What occurs when exercise videos fail to load?
- How does system manage data when patient requests account deletion (LGPD compliance)?
