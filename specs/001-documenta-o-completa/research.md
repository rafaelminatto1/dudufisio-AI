# Research: Comprehensive FisioFlow System

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### **Frontend Framework: React 19 with TypeScript**
**Decision**: React 19 with strict TypeScript configuration
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase already uses React 19
- Strong type safety aligns with constitutional principle I (Type Safety First)
- Mature ecosystem with extensive healthcare app examples
- Excellent PWA support for offline capabilities
**Alternatives considered**: Vue 3, Angular - rejected for consistency with existing codebase

### **State Management: React Context + Custom Hooks**
**Decision**: React Context for global state, custom hooks for component logic
**Rationale**:
- Follows constitutional principle V (Code Quality & Architecture)
- Avoids over-engineering for current scale (744 patients)
- Integrates well with React Hook Form for form state
**Alternatives considered**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand - rejected for complexity overhead

### **Database & Backend: Supabase**
**Decision**: Supabase with PostgreSQL and RLS policies
**Rationale**:
- Built-in authentication with role-based access control
- Real-time subscriptions for appointment updates
- LGPD compliance features (data export, deletion)
- Row Level Security for healthcare data protection
**Alternatives considered**: Firebase, custom Node.js - rejected for compliance complexity

### **UI Component Library: shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS**
**Decision**: shadcn/ui components with TailwindCSS for styling
**Rationale**:
- Already in use in existing codebase
- Accessible by default (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Customizable for medical UI patterns
- Small bundle size impact
**Alternatives considered**: Material-UI, Chakra UI - rejected for consistency

### **Form Management: React Hook Form + Zod**
**Decision**: React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe validation aligns with constitution
- Excellent performance for complex medical forms
- Built-in error handling and field validation
**Alternatives considered**: Formik, native form state - rejected for type safety

### **Authentication & Authorization: Supabase Auth**
**Decision**: Supabase Auth with custom role management
**Rationale**:
- Four role types: Admin, Fisioterapeuta, Estagiário, Paciente
- Secure session management
- Integration with RLS policies for data access control
**Alternatives considered**: Auth0, custom JWT - rejected for integration simplicity

### **File Storage: Supabase Storage**
**Decision**: Supabase Storage for patient photos, exercise videos, documents
**Rationale**:
- Integrated with authentication system
- LGPD compliant with deletion capabilities
- CDN for optimal performance
**Alternatives considered**: AWS S3, Cloudinary - rejected for integration complexity

### **Charts & Analytics: Recharts**
**Decision**: Recharts for dashboard visualizations
**Rationale**:
- Already in use in existing codebase
- React-first design with TypeScript support
- Small bundle size (<50KB)
**Alternatives considered**: Chart.js, D3.js - rejected for consistency

### **Testing Strategy: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright**
**Decision**: Multi-layer testing approach
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests: Jest + RTL for components and hooks
- Integration tests: RTL for user flows
- E2E tests: Playwright for critical healthcare workflows
- Supports TDD constitutional requirement
**Alternatives considered**: Cypress, Vitest - chose for existing ecosystem

### **Performance Optimization Strategy**
**Decision**: React.lazy() + code splitting + bundle analysis
**Rationale**:
- Meet constitutional <1MB bundle requirement
- Lazy loading for all page components
- Performance monitoring with Vite bundle analyzer
**Alternatives considered**: Next.js SSR - rejected for existing SPA architecture

### **PWA Implementation: Vite PWA Plugin**
**Decision**: Vite PWA plugin with service worker
**Rationale**:
- Offline-first for critical operations (appointments, patient data)
- App-like experience on mobile devices
- Background sync for appointment updates
**Alternatives considered**: Manual service worker - rejected for maintenance overhead

### **Internationalization: Not Required**
**Decision**: Portuguese-only interface for initial implementation
**Rationale**:
- Brazilian clinic with Portuguese-speaking patients
- LGPD compliance text in Portuguese
- Future i18n can be added incrementally

### **Real-time Features: Supabase Realtime**
**Decision**: Real-time subscriptions for appointment updates
**Rationale**:
- Multiple users scheduling simultaneously
- Instant calendar updates prevent conflicts
- Notification system for appointment changes

## Architecture Patterns

### **Component Architecture**
- Page components in `pages/` (lazy-loaded)
- Reusable UI components in `components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components in `components/{feature}/`
- Business logic in `services/`
- Custom hooks in `hooks/`
- Global state in `contexts/`

### **Data Flow Pattern**
1. Pages consume data via custom hooks
2. Hooks call service functions
3. Services interact with Supabase
4. Type safety maintained throughout chain

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- Global error boundary for React errors
- Service-level error handling with typed errors
- User-friendly error messages in Portuguese
- Error logging for debugging

### **Security Implementation**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies per user role
- Data encryption at rest (Supabase default)
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Audit logging for patient data access

## Integration Points

### **Gemini AI Integration**
- Treatment recommendations based on patient history
- Exercise prescription suggestions
- Clinical decision support (with disclaimers)

### **WhatsApp Integration (Future)**
- Appointment confirmations and reminders
- Patient communication portal

### **PIX Payment Integration (Future)**
- Brazilian payment method integration
- Financial transaction recording

## Performance Targets Validation

| Requirement | Implementation Strategy | Expected Result |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| <2s page load | React.lazy + code splitting | 1.5s average |
| <1MB bundles | Route-based chunking | 800KB per route |
| <500ms API | Supabase edge functions | 300ms average |
| <100MB memory | Efficient React patterns | 80MB typical |
| PWA offline | Service worker caching | Core features available |

## LGPD Compliance Implementation

### Data Subject Rights
- **Access**: Dashboard for patients to view their data
- **Rectification**: Profile editing capabilities
- **Erasure**: Account deletion with cascade
- **Portability**: Data export in JSON/PDF format
- **Consent**: Explicit consent forms with tracking

### Technical Measures
- Pseudonymization of sensitive data
- Data minimization principles
- Regular backup procedures
- Incident response procedures
- Privacy by design implementation
